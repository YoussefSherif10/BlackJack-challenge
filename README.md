# BlackJack-challenge
This challenge is a small front end web project. It simulates the BlackJack game. The game is simply picking a card and add its value to the score. To win the game your score should never exceed 21 and must be higher than the bot score. The bot score is generated in this game automatically and randomly with a specific javascript algorithm that makes it really hard to lose.
